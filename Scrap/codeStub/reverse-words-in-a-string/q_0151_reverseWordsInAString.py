class Solution:
    """Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

    A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

    Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.*

    **Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "the sky is blue"
    Output: "blue is sky the"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "  hello world  "
    Output: "world hello"
    Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: s = "a good   example"
    Output: "example good a"
    Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 10^{4}`
    * `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
    * There is **at least one** word in `s`.



    **Follow-up:**If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?
