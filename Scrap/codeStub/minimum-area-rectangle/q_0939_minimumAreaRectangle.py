class Solution:
    """You are given an array of points in the **X-Y** plane `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

    Return *the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the X and Y axes*. If there is not any such rectangle, return `0`.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/03/rec1.JPG)
    ```
    Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
    Output: 4
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/03/rec2.JPG)
    ```
    Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
    Output: 2
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= points.length <= 500`
    * `points[i].length == 2`
    * `0 <= xi, yi <= 4 * 10^{4}`
    * All the given points are **unique**.
