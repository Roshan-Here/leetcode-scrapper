class Solution:
    """You are given a string `s`, which is known to be a concatenation of **anagrams** of some string `t`.

    Return the **minimum** possible length of the string `t`.

    An **anagram** is formed by rearranging the letters of a string. For example, "aab", "aba", and, "baa" are anagrams of "aab".



    **Example 1:**

    Input: s = "abba"

    Output: 2

    Explanation:

    One possible string `t` could be `"ba"`.

    **Example 2:**

    Input: s = "cdef"

    Output: 4

    Explanation:

    One possible string `t` could be `"cdef"`, notice that `t` can be equal to `s`.



    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 10^{5}`
    * `s` consist only of lowercase English letters.
