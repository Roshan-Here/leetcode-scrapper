    """Given an integer `n`, return *the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than* `n`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 10
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 0
    Output: 0

    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: n = 1
    Output: 0
