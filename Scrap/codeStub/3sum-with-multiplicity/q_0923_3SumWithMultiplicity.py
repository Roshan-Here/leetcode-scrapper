class Solution:
    """Given an integer array `arr`, and an integer `target`, return the number of tuples `i, j, k` such that `i < j < k` and `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target`.

    As the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `10^{9} + 7`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
    Output: 20
    Explanation:
    Enumerating by the values (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]):
    (1, 2, 5) occurs 8 times;
    (1, 3, 4) occurs 8 times;
    (2, 2, 4) occurs 2 times;
    (2, 3, 3) occurs 2 times.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,2,2], target = 5
    Output: 12
    Explanation:
    arr[i] = 1, arr[j] = arr[k] = 2 occurs 12 times:
    We choose one 1 from [1,1] in 2 ways,
    and two 2s from [2,2,2,2] in 6 ways.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: arr = [2,1,3], target = 6
    Output: 1
    Explanation: (1, 2, 3) occured one time in the array so we return 1.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `3 <= arr.length <= 3000`
    * `0 <= arr[i] <= 100`
    * `0 <= target <= 300`
