class Solution:
    """Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file `words.txt`.

    For simplicity sake, you may assume:

    * `words.txt` contains only lowercase characters and space `' '` characters.
    * Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
    * Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

    **Example:**

    Assume that `words.txt` has the following content:

    ```
    the day is sunny the the
    the sunny is is
    ```
    Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:

    ```
    the 4
    is 3
    sunny 2
    day 1
    ```
    **Note:**

    * Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
    * Could you write it in one-line using [Unix pipes](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-4.html)?
