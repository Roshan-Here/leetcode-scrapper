class Solution:
    """Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get *long pressed*, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

    You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
    Output: true
    Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
    Output: false
    Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= name.length, typed.length <= 1000`
    * `name` and `typed` consist of only lowercase English letters.
