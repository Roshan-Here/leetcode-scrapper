class Solution:
    """Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return *the number of **common** factors of* `a` *and* `b`.

    An integer `x` is a **common factor** of `a` and `b` if `x` divides both `a` and `b`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: a = 12, b = 6
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: a = 25, b = 30
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= a, b <= 1000`
