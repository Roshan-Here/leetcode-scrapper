class Solution:
    """Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

    **Note:** You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
    Output: "6"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
    Output: "56088"
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
    * `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
    * Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.
