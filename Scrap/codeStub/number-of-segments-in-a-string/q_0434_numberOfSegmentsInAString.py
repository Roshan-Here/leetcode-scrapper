class Solution:
    """Given a string `s`, return *the number of segments in the string*.

    A **segment** is defined to be a contiguous sequence of **non-space characters**.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The five segments are ["Hello,", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "Hello"
    Output: 1
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `0 <= s.length <= 300`
    * `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, or one of the following characters `"!@#$%^&*()_+-=',.:"`.
    * The only space character in `s` is `' '`.
