class Solution:
    """You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

    Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of `n` with value 1.

    Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n` with value 1.

    Note that bits are indexed from **right to left** in the binary representation of a number.

    Return the array `[even, odd]`.



    **Example 1:**

    Input: n = 50

    Output: [1,2]

    Explanation:

    The binary representation of 50 is `110010`.

    It contains 1 on indices 1, 4, and 5.

    **Example 2:**

    Input: n = 2

    Output: [0,1]

    Explanation:

    The binary representation of 2 is `10`.

    It contains 1 only on index 1.



    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 1000`
