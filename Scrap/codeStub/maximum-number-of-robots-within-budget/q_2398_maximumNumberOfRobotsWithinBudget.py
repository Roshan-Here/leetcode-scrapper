class Solution:
    """You have `n` robots. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`, both of length `n`. The `i^{th}` robot costs `chargeTimes[i]` units to charge and costs `runningCosts[i]` units to run. You are also given an integer `budget`.

    The **total cost** of running `k` chosen robots is equal to `max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts)`, where `max(chargeTimes)` is the largest charge cost among the `k` robots and `sum(runningCosts)` is the sum of running costs among the `k` robots.

    Return *the **maximum** number of **consecutive** robots you can run such that the total cost **does not** exceed* `budget`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
    To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.
    It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: chargeTimes = [11,12,19], runningCosts = [10,8,7], budget = 19
    Output: 0
    Explanation: No robot can be run that does not exceed the budget, so we return 0.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `chargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n`
    * `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^{4}`
    * `1 <= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] <= 10^{5}`
    * `1 <= budget <= 10^{15}`
