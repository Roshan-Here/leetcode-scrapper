class Solution:
    """Given a rectangle of size `n` x `m`, return *the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the rectangle*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/17/sample_11_1592.png)

    ```
    Input: n = 2, m = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 3 squares are necessary to cover the rectangle.
    2 (squares of 1x1)
    1 (square of 2x2)
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/17/sample_22_1592.png)

    ```
    Input: n = 5, m = 8
    Output: 5
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: n = 11, m = 13
    Output: 6
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n, m <= 13`
