class Solution:
    """We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

    * All letters in this word are capitals, like `"USA"`.
    * All letters in this word are not capitals, like `"leetcode"`.
    * Only the first letter in this word is capital, like `"Google"`.

    Given a string `word`, return `true` if the usage of capitals in it is right.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: word = "USA"
    Output: true
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: word = "FlaG"
    Output: false
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= word.length <= 100`
    * `word` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
