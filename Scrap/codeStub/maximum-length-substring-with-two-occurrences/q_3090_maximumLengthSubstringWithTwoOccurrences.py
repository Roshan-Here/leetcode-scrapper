class Solution:
    """Given a string `s`, return the **maximum** length of a substringÂ such that it contains *at most two occurrences* of each character.


    **Example 1:**

    Input: s = "bcbbbcba"

    Output: 4

    Explanation:

    The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: `"bcbbbcba"`.
    **Example 2:**

    Input: s = "aaaa"

    Output: 2

    Explanation:

    The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: `"aaaa"`.


    **Constraints:**

    * `2 <= s.length <= 100`
    * `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
