class Solution:
    """You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

    Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
    Output: 3
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
    Output: 0
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`
    * `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
    * All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**.
