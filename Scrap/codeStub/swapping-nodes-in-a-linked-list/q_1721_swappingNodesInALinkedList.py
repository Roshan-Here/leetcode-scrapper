    """You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

    Return *the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the* `k^{th}` *node from the beginning and the* `k^{th}` *node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**).*



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/linked1.jpg)
    ```
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
    Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
    Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
    * `1 <= k <= n <= 10^{5}`
    * `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
