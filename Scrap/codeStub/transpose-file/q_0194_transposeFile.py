class Solution:
    """Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

    You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is separated by the `' '` character.

    **Example:**

    If `file.txt` has the following content:

    ```
    name age
    alice 21
    ryan 30
    ```
    Output the following:

    ```
    name alice ryan
    age 21 30
    ```"""
