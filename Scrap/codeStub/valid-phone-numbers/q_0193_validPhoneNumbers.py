class Solution:
    """Given a text file `file.txt` that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

    You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

    You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

    **Example:**

    Assume that `file.txt` has the following content:

    ```
    987-123-4567
    123 456 7890
    (123) 456-7890
    ```
    Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:

    ```
    987-123-4567
    (123) 456-7890
    ```"""
